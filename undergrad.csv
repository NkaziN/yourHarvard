From the nautical sense we also understand any volume, which fills or occupies a liquid space that changes to accommodate it, a useful metaphor for intellectual displacements—as we bend, shift and make room for new ideas in our minds. In psychology, a displacement is the transference of a site of trauma from one person, scenario, or object to another. Finally, there are historie"

Introduction to Asian American Literature: What Is Asian American Literature?,ENGLISH 181A,Kim,FAS,English,2019 Fall,Full Term,1:30pm - 2:45pm,"Aiiieeeee! An Anthology of Asian-American Writers (1974) was one of the earliest attempts to collect writings that were, to quote the editors, “exclusively Asian-American.” Yet as their lengthy—and controversial—explanation of the selection process makes clear, Asian American literature defies neat categorization. This course is both a survey of Asian American literature and an introduction to ongoing debates about what constitutes Asian American literature. We will study"

The Essay: History and Practice,ENGLISH 185E,Wood,FAS,English,2019 Fall,Full Term,3:00pm - 4:15pm,"Matthew Arnold famously said that poetry is, at bottom, “a criticism of life.” But if any literary form is truly a criticism of life, it is the essay. And yet despite the fact that all students write essays, most students rarely study them; bookshops and libraries categorize such work only negatively, by what it is not: “non-fiction.” At the same time, the essay is at present one of the most productive and fertile of literary forms. It is practiced as memoir, reportage, d"

For example, how do we measure inequality, and at what point does it become problematic (and how do we know)? How then should it be addressed (e.g., tax code, minimum wage)?

Though our focus is modernism, we will be engaging with examples of similar debates from other periods, such as challenges to the medieval/ Renaissance divide, calls for “presentist Shakespeare,” the manifesto of the Victorian v21 collective, and discussions regarding the utility of labelling contemporary literature as “post-45.” We will examine the c"

First Stars and Life in the Cosmos,FRSEMR 21G,Loeb,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2020 Spring,Full Term,12:00pm - 2:30pm,"Since the Universe is expanding, it must have been denser in the past. But even before we get all the way back to the Big Bang, there must have been a time when stars like our Sun did not exist because the Universe was denser than they are. Since stars are needed to keep us warm, we face the important question about our origins: how and when did the first stars form? Primitive versions of this question were considered by humans in religious and philosophical texts for thousands of years. The Sem"

Why We Animals Sing,FRSEMR 22T,Farrell,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2020 Spring,Full Term,9:45am - 11:45am,"We do not sing alone. On land, four kinds of animals produce songs or calls: birds, frogs, mammals, and insects. Some of these (and fish) also do so underwater. The principal sounds such animal species make are signaling behaviors directly related to mating success. They are of individuals, usually males, marking territories, and wooing mates. However, in any one location, species may also compete with one another for occupation of acoustic space (that is, for bandwidth) and otherwise optimize t"
Exploring the Infinite,FRSEMR 23C,Koellner,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2019 Fall,Full Term,12:00pm - 2:00pm,"Infinity captivates the imagination.

A Brief History of Surgery,FRSEMR 24G,Millham,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2019 Fall,Full Term,6:00pm - 8:45pm,"The history of surgery begins with the Hippocratic physicians whose principles were based, at least partly, on observation and measurement.  However, surgical thinking for first three quarters of the “modern era” was dominated by Galen of Pergamum who, “fooled by his monkeys,” established a school thought as false as it was tightly held.  The exposure of Galen’s errors by Vesalius in 1543 and Harvey in 1628 began a Medical Enlightenment.  It would tak"

We take the nuances of developmental differences for granted because we're so accustomed to experiencing them.

Death and Immortality,FRSEMR 30Q,Chen,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2019 Fall,Full Term,12:00pm - 2:00pm,"In this seminar, we will discuss philosophical questions about death and immortality. What is death? Is there a moral difference between ""brain death"" and the irreversible loss of consciousness? Is the classification of a person as dead a moral judgment, or is it an entirely scientific matter? Is death a misfortune to the person who dies? How can death be a misfortune if you are no longer around to experience that misfortune? Is it possible to survive after death? What does it mean for"
Nietzsche,FRSEMR 31D,Risse,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2019 Fall,Full Term,6:00pm - 8:45pm,Friedrich Nietzsche addresses some of the big questions of human existence in a profoundly searching but often disturbing manner that continues to resonate with many. Hardly any philosopher (except Karl Marx) has exercised such a far-reaching and penetrating impact on intellectual life in the last 150 years or so. He has influenced thinkers and activists across the political spectrum. Nietzsche has always been of special interest to young people who have often appreciated the irreverence and fre
Magic and Other Virtual Realities,FRSEMR 31E,Kuriyama,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2019 Fall,Full Term,9:00am - 11:45am,"This seminar explores our remarkable propensity, as human beings, to respond viscerally to simulacra of realities as if they were real—even though we know, intellectually, that they aren’t. Think of how movies make us laugh and cry, even though we know that they are just fleeting images on a screen. Think of how colored pills can dissolve our pains, even after we learn that they are not “real” medicines, but mere placebos. And think of the hypnotic spell cast by certain c"
Skepticism and Knowledge,FRSEMR 31J,Elgin,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2019 Fall,Full Term,3:00pm - 5:00pm,"What can we know; how can we know it? Can I know that I am not a brain in a vat being manipulated into thinking that I have a body? Can I know that Lincoln was assassinated, that electrons have negative charge, that Hamlet is a masterpiece, that the sun will rise tomorrow? This seminar will study skeptical arguments and responses to them to explore the nature and scope of knowledge."
In Pursuit of the Ordinary: Genre Painting in Boston-Area Museums,FRSEMR 31M,Koerner,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2019 Fall,Full Term,12:00pm - 2:45pm,"This seminar looks at portrayals of everyday life in art, mostly from Europe and America, and mostly in the medium of painting. Examining original art objects in different Boston-area collections, we investigate this type of imagery as it develops into a distinct tradition. We observe its beginnings in medieval marginalia.  We trace its evolution into a specialty product from the Renaissance and through its heyday in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, when it came to be called &ldquo"
Beauty and Christianity,FRSEMR 31N,Kiely,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2019 Fall,Full Term,3:00pm - 5:00pm,"In Book X of The Confessions Augustine wrote, ""I have learned to love you late, Beauty at once so ancient and so new!""  In addressing God as source and model of beauty, Augustine joins theology and aesthetics in one sentiment that has informed and sometimes troubled Christianity throughout its history.  There is no doubt that the life and teachings of Jesus have inspired some of the greatest works of art, literature, and music in Western culture, but it is also true that Chri"
Food for Thought: Culinary Culture in Spain and Beyond,FRSEMR 32M,Liander,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2020 Spring,Full Term,3:00pm - 5:00pm,"The French have said that the history of a nation depends on what they eat. Yet in the case of Spain, it’s clearly the reverse. What Spain has eaten has been a consequence of the country’s vast -and often turbulent- history. Invasions, expansions, exile and immigration have created and continue to create the cuisine and culture, which will be our focus in this seminar. Likewise, we will consider Spain’s culinary exchange with Latin America, with specific reference to Argentina,"
"Borges, García Márquez, Bolaño and Other Classics of Modern Latin American Fiction and Poetry",FRSEMR 33C,Siskind,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2019 Fall,Full Term,3:00pm - 5:00pm,"This course introduces students to some of the most important Latin American literary works produced during the twentieth century. We will explore the ways in which these novels, short-stories, essays and poems interrogate the historical traumas, political contexts and aesthetic potential of the region between 1920s and 1980s. We will shed light on their place in the historical and cultural formation of the literary canon, as well as on the concept of ‘classic’. The goal of this semi"

With a partially hands-on approach, we shall look at the fundamental principles that make up the sound system and govern the grammar of Mandarin, with particular attention to those features that distinguish Chinese from English and other languages, including its system of tones, its writing system, its word-order and syntac"
Complexity in Works of Art: Ulysses and Hamlet,FRSEMR 33X,Fisher,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2019 Fall,Full Term,3:00pm - 5:00pm,"Is the complexity, the imperfection, the difficulty of interpretation, the unresolved meaning found in certain great and lasting works of literary art a result of technical experimentation?  Or is the source extreme complexity—psychological, metaphysical, or spiritual?  Does it result from limits within language, or from language’s fit to thought and perception?  Do the inherited forms found in literature permit only certain variations within experience to reach lucidi"
Broadway Musicals: History and Performance,FRSEMR 34V,Oja,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2020 Spring,Full Term,9:45am - 11:45am,"This seminar will explore a core group of Broadway musicals.

Language and Prehistory,FRSEMR 34X,Jasanoff,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2019 Fall,Full Term,3:00pm - 5:45pm,"It was discovered around 1800 that the major languages of Europe, along with the ancient languages of India and Iran, were descended from an unattested parent, formerly known as ""Aryan"" or ""Indo-Germanic,"" but today usually called Proto-Indo-European. The identification of the Indo-European family raised many questions, some purely linguistic (e.g., what was Proto-Indo-European like; was it grammatically complex or ""primitive""?), and some more far-reaching (e.g., wh"
The Art and Craft of Acting,FRSEMR 35N,Airaldi,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2019 Fall,Full Term,3:00pm - 5:00pm,"We’ve all watched a great performance and wondered, “How did that actor do that?” Acting is undoubtedly the most popular, most widely experienced of the performing arts and yet, in many ways, it remains a mystery. This seminar will give students an opportunity to demystify the art of acting by introducing them to the basic tools of the trade; they will learn about the craft of acting by actually “doing” it. It will provide an introduction to acting by combining elem"
The Creative Work of Translating,FRSEMR 36G,Sandler,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2019 Fall,Full Term,9:45am - 11:45am,"Translation makes culture possible. Individual writers and thinkers draw sustenance and stimulation from works created outside their own cultures, and artists working in one format get ideas from those working in entirely different media. Translation between languages and between art forms will center our seminar’s work. Taking a broad view of translation as a mental activity, we will study poems, fiction, film, photography, film, and music. We will stretch our own imaginative capacities b"
Comparative Historical Mythology,FRSEMR 36S,Witzel,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2019 Fall,Full Term,3:00pm - 5:00pm,"This seminar will deal with an innovative approach to comparative Mythology, detailed in my 700 pp. book on the topic (OUP, Dec. 2012).  Comparative mythology has been a well-trodden but controversial field since at least 1800. The proposed seminar will discuss the matter in a new way by incorporating an historical approach, which has so far been lacking. The two most prominent explanations for the wide-spread, worldwide similarities in myths have been archetypes (C.G. Jung) and diffusion ("
Reading Tolstoy's War and Peace,FRSEMR 37P,Buckler,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2019 Fall,Full Term,3:00pm - 5:00pm,"Leo Tolstoy's massive masterwork War and Peace (1865-69) is a magnificent work of art by a world-class writer tackling life’s “big questions.” It is also a great read!  Over the course of a semester, we will give this nineteenth-century novel the time and attention it deserves.  We will read War and Peace closely, while comparing two different English-language translations, exploring cultural and historical context, artistic biography, historiography, the novel as"

Law and Society through the Cinematic Frame,FRSEMR 40E,Liviatan,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2020 Spring,Full Term,3:45pm - 5:45pm,"In this seminar we will explore the interaction of law and society using the lens of film. The cinematic experience has become a key site through which the public understanding of law is produced, debated and influenced. Driven first and foremost by market and audience considerations, law-related films often inject drama, contentious dimensions and even misrepresentations into the portrayal of real events. Nonetheless, by raising awareness about legal themes that pervade the plot, these films of"
The Supreme Court in U.S. History,FRSEMR 40I,Fallon,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2019 Fall,Full Term,3:00pm - 5:00pm,"Often described as the world's most powerful court, the US Supreme Court has not always enjoyed high prestige or unquestioned authority.

The Role of Government,FRSEMR 42C,Hart,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2020 Spring,Full Term,3:00pm - 5:00pm,"Economists have a very positive view of the role of markets. The intellectual foundations of this are the first and second theorems of welfare economics. The purpose of the seminar is to introduce the students to these results but also to their limitations. For example, for markets to work well it is essential to have a legal system that upholds contracts and protects property rights. The legal system is also important to deter crime. But who can provide the legal system other than a government"
U.S. Energy Policy and Climate Change,FRSEMR 42H,Stock,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2019 Fall,Full Term,3:00pm - 5:00pm,"Burning fossil fuels has powered 150 years of unprecedented economic growth, but doing so has left a legacy of high and increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Those gases are changing our climate and thereby endanger human health, human welfare, and the earth’s ecosystems.

In fact, a major debate still rages among biologists as to what species are, and how they evolve from other species. This seminar will cover these issues. Darwin used impeccable logic and convinced his readership by the 1860s that the entire diversity of life could be explained by means of evolution. Yet it's possible that prior creationist no"

"Talking, Literary Animals",FRSEMR 62F,Simpson,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2019 Fall,Full Term,9:45am - 11:45am,"What do imagined animals have to teach human readers? Why, when literary writers think about hunger, violence, sex, suffering, technology, expressivity, the gods, and education (for example), do they so often draw upon animal behavior to understand human practice? The representation of animals in literature tends to range from the cute to the terrifying, with the beautiful in between: animals are cute when they act like us, beautiful when they express desire, but often terrifying when we realize"
"Experiencing Poetry: Love, War, Nature and Religion in Four Major Twentieth Century Poets",FRSEMR 62I,Rudenstine,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2019 Fall,Full Term,12:00pm - 2:45pm,"In our seminar, we will read four major twentieth century poets—from some of their early work to their latest. The hope will be to see how each poet developed during the course of his or her career. How did their styles and their deepest concerns alter over the course of a lifetime? We will run the seminar as a lively discussion group, and will read the poems in some detail, trying to understand their tones, structures, and cadences—reading them aloud as well as silently. In the work"
Knowing Cicero,FRSEMR 62L,Hudson,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2019 Fall,Full Term,3:00pm - 5:00pm,"More than any other person from Greco-Roman antiquity, the Roman orator, politician, and philosopher Marcus Tullius Cicero (106-43 BCE) appears to be someone we can “get to know.” Over eight hundred detailed, often highly personal, letters of his survive (most not intended for publication), as well as around a hundred from his correspondents, not to mention his fifty-odd extant speeches (most promoting a particular persona) and several self-portraits in his philosophical and rhetoric"
War in Fiction and Film,FRSEMR 62P,Weir,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2019 Fall,Full Term,12:45pm - 2:45pm,"War has always been one of the most important subjects of art and literature, but in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, public ideas about war and military service have been formed increasingly by film and other visual media. In this seminar we will consider the different ways war has been depicted in literature and in films. We will spend some time identifying the conventions and clichés of the genre, and we will have occasion to discuss depictions of war in news coverage, documen"
Thinking about Race and the Law in American History: Liberal and Critical Perspectives,FRSEMR 62Q,Mack,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2019 Fall,Full Term,12:00pm - 2:00pm,"What is race? What is law? What does law have to do with race and racial inequality? We talk about these kinds of questions all the time when we discuss familiar cultural touchstones as the Brown v. Board of Education decision, the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow, and topics such as the Black Lives Matter movement. In this seminar, we will examine the role law has played throughout American history in creating racial categories, maintaining and eliminating racial hierarchy, and policing the borde"
LGBT Life Stories,FRSEMR 62R,Schlossberg,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2019 Fall,Full Term,3:00pm - 5:00pm,"In this seminar we’ll read a range of classic LGBT life stories (memoirs, journals, diaries, essays, and autobiographies), beginning in the 1800s and ending in the present. We will study them as products of their specific historical moment, paying close attention to changing ideas about race, class, gender, and sexuality. Questions: How do people narrate the story of their identity? What aspects of their life histories do they highlight; what do they censor? How does the “coming out"
Challenging Reality: Literature and Social Justice,FRSEMR 62S,Suetterlin,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2019 Fall,Full Term,3:00pm - 5:00pm,"What do vampires, zombies, ghosts, and cyborgs tell us about ourselves and our society? In this seminar we explore how literature critiques social injustices by challenging our notions of reality. Of particular interest to us are texts, films, and visual artworks that push beyond the confines of societal norms through their use of uncanny figures. From the man-made monster breaking loose in Mary Shelley’s Gothic classic Frankenstein, to the ghost of a traumatic past haunting Toni Morrison&"
"Zombies and Spirits, Ghosts and Ghouls: Interactions between the Living and the Dead",FRSEMR 62U,Cohen,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2019 Fall,Full Term,9:45am - 11:45am,"Virtually all the cultures and religions of the world, from ancient to contemporary times, have teachings and rituals about death. In this seminar we will deal with a subset of this very large topic, namely, the relationship of the living and the dead. The dead are often depicted as still‐living in some way and still in communication with us and our world. Are they friendly or hostile? Beneficent or malevolent? Think “undead” and “zombie” versus “saint” and &l"
"Faulkner, Ellison, Morrison",FRSEMR 62V,McCarthy,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2020 Spring,Full Term,3:00pm - 5:30pm,"The “Great American Novel” is infamously a difficult notion to harpoon and reel in, but any list of great American novelists will undoubtedly contain the names of William Faulkner, Ralph Ellison, and Toni Morrison. Together we will read some of the most celebrated and powerful works of fiction produced during what Henry Luce called “The American Century.” We will ponder the significance of these literary giants in relation to U.S. and global history, the role of the novel"
Music from Earth,FRSEMR 62W,Rehding,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2019 Fall,Full Term,9:45am - 11:45am,"In 1977 NASA shot a mixtape into outer space. The “Golden Record,” as it is known, is aboard the Voyager spacecraft, which is now outside the solar system on its way into the unknown. It contains a selection of music from all over the world, environmental sounds, images, and greetings in 55 human languages. The hope was that somehow, sometime, many thousand years from now, extraterrestrials might pick it up and experience a slice of human culture. In 1977 the idea that there might be"
Regulation or Anarchy? The State and its Critics,FRSEMR 62X,Siegel,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2019 Fall,Full Term,3:00pm - 5:00pm,"What are law and government for? What makes them important, and what do they mean to you? Laws can seem abstract and impractical. If no one else is at the intersection and you can see for miles in every direction, do you really have to stop? Teenagers tend to shoplift more than people of other ages. Do you think that’s because they tend not to feel the force of law as strongly as people who don’t? In this seminar we’ll consider some of the most basic justifications offered for"
Back to the Future: How the Past Imagined the Cities of Tomorrow,FRSEMR 62Y,Carvalho,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2019 Fall,Full Term,3:00pm - 5:00pm,"Humans spend a lot of time thinking about the future. In this seminar we will discuss how urban futures were imagined in the past. And how things often turn out in very unexpected ways. European colonizers projected fantasies about the future onto the Americas, and in the past two centuries we have witnessed a boom in utopian and dystopian works about cities. We can think of much of modernity in terms of competing visions of what the future ought to be like. Besides flying vehicles, in the 1920s"
"Buddhist Enlightenment: Visions, Words, and Practice",FRSEMR 62Z,Abe,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2020 Spring,Full Term,3:00pm - 5:00pm,"How do you get enlightened?  Is the Buddha a god or human? How many Buddhas are there in the world? How many celebrated enlightened women do we find in Buddhism? How do you know if someone is enlightened? And why does Enlightenment matter? These are basic questions that even most recondite books of Buddhism often fail to answer. This seminar looks at famous visual images of Buddhist enlightenment—not only iconographies of Buddhist divinities, but also architecture, gardens, ritual ins"
The Symphonies of Dmitri Shostakovich,FRSEMR 63C,Shreffler,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2019 Fall,Full Term,3:00pm - 5:00pm,"The symphonies of Dmitri Shostakovich (1906-75) are just as relevant and controversial today as they were during the composer's lifetime. Shostakovich's fifteen symphonies span his entire creative life; starting with his First Symphony, which made the 19-year old composer famous overnight, and ending with his Fifteenth, completed four years before his death. As a public genre, the symphony was the perfect vehicle for Shostakovich to react to his tumultuous times and explore the human psy"
Ancient Greek Tragedy for the 21st Century,FRSEMR 63D,Weiss,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2019 Fall,Full Term,3:00pm - 5:00pm,"In Athens in the fifth century BCE, thousands would gather at the theater to see the latest plays of Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, and their contemporaries. Their tragedies grappled with pressing questions of the day: What are the consequences of war? Why should we believe in god(s)? Should we obey the law or put our family first? What happens if a woman has power? How different are we from foreigners? 2500 years later, the handful of tragedies that survive continue to be performed and adapte"

What does religion do for human beings? What does an evolutionary and biologically informed understanding of the mind and brain lead us to think about where religion fits in human life? Harvard’s first psychologist, William James, engaged these questions in the late nineteenth century, bringing the cutting"
Gnosticism and Film,FRSEMR 63F,Stang,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2019 Fall,Full Term,3:00pm - 5:00pm,"Are you anxious about political surveillance and domination, the dangers of technological innovation (especially artificial intelligence), the possibility of alien life and its intentions, and the threat of environmental devastation, and other apocalyptic futures? You’re not alone:  contemporary filmmakers are constantly exploring these themes. What may surprise you, however, is that these filmmakers are increasingly turning to an ancient spirituality, sometimes called “Gnostici"
Ethics for a Broken World,FRSEMR 63H,Hall,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2019 Fall,Full Term,9:00am - 11:45am,"This seminar borrows its title from philosopher Tim Mulgan’s book of the same name. Mulgan imagines how basic questions about ethics and political justice might look to our descendants in one all-too-possible world: a “broken” world in which critical natural systems can no longer be depended on for basic goods, where disaster strikes unpredictably and peace cannot be guaranteed. The book takes the form of a series of philosophy lectures, drawn from a course taught some time in"
The First Americans: Portraits of Indigenous Power and Diplomacy,FRSEMR 63I,Kinew,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2019 Fall,Full Term,12:00pm - 2:45pm,"Harvard’s Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology is home to 25 oil portraits of indigenous American leaders painted in the first half of the 19th century. Originally commissioned to preserve cultures an American bureaucrat feared would be extinct, these paintings transcend a moribund history. In fact, the Native American nations represented are still here. Moreover, these portraits have much to teach us about diplomacy, power, representation and indigeneity in 2019. The Peabody portra"
Islam vs. Image?: Visual Representations in Islamic Art,FRSEMR 63J,Roxburgh,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2019 Fall,Full Term,3:00pm - 5:00pm,"Is Islam against images? For reasons that are perplexing and hard to pinpoint, this notion appears to have been promoted by ideas about Islamic doctrine and an endemic hostility toward images which has only been magnified after recent years of religious extremism and terrorism. These include the Taliban’s destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas in Afghanistan in 2001, and the Charlie Hebdo mass shooting in Paris 2015 over the cartoons representing the Prophet Muhammad. And yet there is ample ev"
Entrepreneurship and Venture Capital in the Global Economy,FRSEMR 70G,Gompers,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2020 Spring,Full Term,6:00pm - 8:45pm,"Entrepreneurial activity has been a potent source of innovation and job generation in the global economy.  In the U.S., the majority of new jobs are generated by new entrepreneurial firms.  Entrepreneurship has had many definitions over the past two and one half centuries since Richard Cantillon first used the term in the early 18th century. Some have focused on the risk-bearing nature of entrepreneurship, while others have focused on the innovations that entrepreneurs create. Both are"
"Morality, Leadership, and Gray-Area Decisions",FRSEMR 70K,Badaracco,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2019 Fall,Full Term,3:00pm - 5:00pm,"Everyone with serious responsibilities, at work and throughout their lives, faces gray area decisions. In organizations, these highly uncertain, high-stakes decisions are delegated upward, to men and women in leadership positions. They have to make final decisions on these problems, despite the gray, and these decisions test their competence and their humanity. This seminar offers a variety of important perspectives on gray-area problems and on ways to resolve them, responsibly and effectively."

Law at Work: Employment Rights in the Age of Uber,FRSEMR 70V,Sachs,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2020 Spring,Full Term,3:00pm - 5:00pm,"Work is what most of us do with most of our time.  Even before we start a career, we invest our energy in preparing for work and in imagining what work life will be.  In this seminar, we explore the multiple ways that law defines what work is like in the contemporary United States.  We start with the question of how much power an employer should have over employee: should it really be legal to fire someone for wearing the wrong tie or having the wrong spouse?  We then debate"
"Regulating Online Conduct: Speech, Privacy, and the Use and Sharing of Content",FRSEMR 70Z,Bavitz,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2019 Fall,Full Term,9:45am - 11:45am,"In the course of a few short decades, the Internet has become integral to significant swaths of human experience. It has radically altered modes of interpersonal engagement, democratized access to tools of mass communication, and changed the role of gatekeepers that traditionally controlled access to music, video, and other media. Given the breadth of its impact, it is not surprising that the Internet has pushed the bounds of legal doctrines that govern speech, privacy, and the creation and expl"
The Supreme Court and Social Change: Lessons from Landmark Cases and Key Reform Movements,FRSEMR 71C,Brown-Nagin,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2020 Spring,Full Term,9:45am - 11:45am,Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes famously wrote: “The life of the law has not been logic; it has been experience.” This seminar considers the idea of experience—including events external to legal doctrine—affecting the law. It discusses how social movements—groups of citizens mobilized in support of a cause—deploy the Constitution and other types of rights talk to “frame” disputes and move forward their agendas.  Seminar participants will discuss
The Origins of the Human Mind,FRSEMR 71F,Carey,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2020 Spring,Full Term,3:00pm - 5:00pm,"The adult human mind is a unique phenomenon on earth.   Only people can ponder the causes of and cures for global warming or pancreatic cancer, and can think thoughts about molecules, genes, democracy…  Animals, and human infants, do not have most of the 500,000 concepts expressed by words in English. How does the human mind work, and how can we understand how it came to be, with its vast repertoire of concepts from which we routinely compose thoughts? In this seminar, we w"

And will the jobs be worth having?  People have worried about losing their jobs to technology at least since the Luddites 200 years ago.  In the aggregate, they have been wrong.  The automobile put lots of stable boys and saddle makers out of work, but it created vastly more jobs making cars, and fueling them and repairing them, and it opened the way for whole new industries like roads"

The Heart of Medicine: Patients and Physicians and the Experience of Serious Illness,FRSEMR 71O,Block,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2019 Fall,Full Term,3:00pm - 5:00pm,"Sickness and death are universal human experiences.  Yet we are often uncomfortable talking and thinking about them in relation to ourselves, and to those whom we love. The core thesis of this seminar is that exploring these human vulnerabilities is a way of learning to live a more meaningful life, strengthening relationships, and helping us be better caretakers of people we love, and of people whom we serve in a professional role.   In this seminar, we propose to examine, from mu"
Making Places and Spaces in Modern America,FRSEMR 71P,Cohen,FAS,Freshman Seminars,2019 Fall,Full Term,6:00pm - 8:45pm,"How did a home in 1945 compare to one in 2000? Did the opening of shopping malls in the 1950s change people’s consumer habits? What made living in suburbs similar to and dissimilar from cities?

So inextricably linked are our modern lives to the assembly line. This, however, has not always been the case. Only in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries did factories become the primary sites of production in industrializing countries, churning out, through the toil of laborers and the working of machines, an ever-widening assortment of goods.

However, the use of spies was many centuries ago taken extremely seriously by political theorists in the pre-modern Chinese, South Asian, and Roman worlds, by Sun Tzu, Kautilya, and Livy, respectively. Sun Tzu emphasized the use of spies to see into the mind of the enemy in order to defeat his plans. Kautilya and Livy focused more on the role that secret agents could play in uncove"

Within just three years, body weight ideals had transformed from large to thin and purging had become as common in Fijian high school girls as in their Massachusetts counterparts.

We are the only ones who expend tremendous amounts of time, energy, and resources trying (sometimes obsessively) to understand our futures before they happen. While the innate ability of individual people to predict has not changed much in the past few millennia, developments in mathematical and conceptual models have inordinately improved predictive systems. These systems have integrated comparisons to past"
"Race, Gender, and Performance",GENED 1113,Bernstein,FAS,General Education,2020 Spring,Full Term,12:00pm - 1:15pm,"Performance surrounds us.

Painting's Doubt: What Artmaking Lets Us See and Say,GENED 1114,Saunders,FAS,General Education,2020 Spring,Full Term,1:30pm - 2:45pm,"Painting is an engagement between the self and the world. It is a practice of embodied making, and, as a language outside of words, can think around conditioned understanding. This introductory studio art course proposes learning to paint as a new experience of relating to the world, and through painting we will investigate not only what we have to say, but what we have to see.Studio assignments in small sections are complemented by weekly lectures, visiting artist presentations, readings and vi"
"Human Trafficking, Slavery and Abolition in the Modern World",GENED 1115,Patterson,FAS,General Education,2020 Spring,Full Term,12:00pm - 1:15pm,"We often think of slavery as being a dark chapter in our past, but this is a tragic oversimplification. What defines slavery in the modern world, and what are the moral, political and social implications of its continued existence? The mechanisms of many forms of bondage are secretive and illegal, making it difficult to quantify the number of people affected by this persistent institution. As we explore its underpinnings, we discover that all of us may be in some way complicit in its survival. T"
Medical Ethics and History,GENED 1116,Jones,FAS,General Education,2019 Fall,Full Term,10:30am - 11:45am,"Students will encounter the ethical dilemmas of medical practice throughout their lives, whether with their own health, or with the health their families and friends.

Nature,GENED 1117,Chaplin,FAS,General Education,2020 Spring,Full Term,1:30pm - 2:45pm,"The planet is in crisis; we live in a state of emergency. Our emergency circumstances encompass a range of daunting environmental problems that make inaction simply not an option. We need to think clearly and calmly about this crisis to craft the best possible solutions. But the kind of clear, calm thought we will need to use requires two kinds of understanding. First, we must think with precision about what nature is, especially in its ethical dimensions. Second, we will need to understand how"
The Holocaust,GENED 1118,Madigan,FAS,General Education,2019 Fall,Full Term,10:30am - 11:45am,"Who is responsible for genocide? Through the lens of the Holocaust – perhaps the most-studied genocide of the modern era – we will grapple with the issues of good and evil, blame and responsibility, duty and dissent as they pertain to violence enacted at the personal and state levels. What is the responsibility of “citizens and citizen leaders” in the face of local and global crises brought on by genocide, refugee catastrophes, terror, neo-fascism, etc.? And how do we mak"
"Law, Politics, and Trade Policy: Lessons from East Asia",GENED 1119,Davis,FAS,General Education,2020 Spring,Full Term,3:00pm - 4:15pm,"How do states balance the challenges and opportunities of international markets?

From the “unequal treaties” of the nineteenth century to the World Trade Organization today, trade law binds the interactions between East Asia and the world. Japa"
The Political Economy of Globalization,GENED 1120,Summers,FAS,General Education,2019 Fall,Full Term,10:30am - 11:45am,Why is populism becoming pervasive - and is there a revolt against global integration? What is the right balance between national sovereignty and international integration? Is the US equipped to sustain its role as a global leader? How does international trade affect prosperity and inequality? Should we regulate multi-national companies who move their factories to countries with lower labor standards? How should the IMF respond to financial crises in Europe and the developing world? How will the
Economic Justice,GENED 1121,Risse,FAS,General Education,2020 Spring,Full Term,10:30am - 11:45am,"Which is more just: capitalism or socialism? Capitalism has long reigned as the ideological solution to organizing society, yet recent social science literature makes clear that the pursuit of seemingly boundless material gain for some comes at the expense of others. Climate change is increasingly tied to capitalism and industrialization, and the U.S. has seen growing discontent around an ever-widening gap between the richest of the rich and the poorest of the poor. Socialism addresses this weal"
Islam and Politics in the Modern Middle East,GENED 1123,Zeghal,FAS,General Education,2019 Fall,Full Term,12:00pm - 2:45pm,"Today’s news headlines consistently point to the role that religion plays in the political life of Middle Eastern societies. But do these headlines tell the whole story? This course will challenge simplistic explanations of the dominant role of Islam in Middle Eastern politics by putting it in historical perspective. You will explore the genealogy of some of the most important debates about the role of religion in politics: the extent of Middle Eastern states' involvement in religion,"

Loss,GENED 1131,Coleman,FAS,General Education,2019 Fall,Full Term,1:30pm - 2:45pm," Loss is an inevitable fact of human existence. Small losses most of us learn to bear with equanimity. But enormous, wrenching, life-changing losses open voids in our lives for which we can never feel adequately prepared, even if we can see them coming. This course tries to understand the nature of loss on a physical and emotional level, to give us some framework for coping with it and to help us develop some empathy in those very difficult situations when someone else has faced a loss and"
Is the U.S. Civil War Still Being Fought?,GENED 1133,Stauffer,FAS,General Education,2020 Spring,Full Term,12:00pm - 1:15pm,"Most of us were taught that the Civil War between the Confederacy and the Union was fought on battlefields chiefly in the American South between the years of 1861-1865. In this narrative, the North won and the South lost. But what if the issues that resulted in such devastating bloodshed were never resolved? What if the war never ended? This course demonstrates the ways in which the United States is still fighting the Civil War, arguably THE defining event in U.S. history. In each class, we"
Interracial Encounters in American Literature and Culture,GENED 1135,Kim,FAS,General Education,2020 Spring,Full Term,1:30pm - 2:45pm,"From depictions of exchanges in the early colonial Americas to efforts to envision alternate and imminent futures, this class will examine representations of interracial encounters in U.S. American culture.

Topics addressed in this course will include narratives"
Power and Civilization: China,GENED 1136,Kirby,FAS,General Education,2019 Fall,Full Term,9:00am - 11:00am,"In China today we see a new country built on the bedrock of an ancient civilization. China’s re-emergence as a global economic power and political model has deep roots. From Rome to the Romanovs, from Byzantium to the Ottomans, on to the global empires of the West, all the great multiethnic empires of the world have come and gone, while a unitary, multi-national, Chinese empire has endured. The ancient Chinese ideal of a single, unified civilized world has had consequences. It was, and sti"
The Challenge of Human Induced Climate Change: Transitioning to a Post Fossil Fuel Future,GENED 1137,McElroy,FAS,General Education,2020 Spring,Full Term,1:30pm - 2:45pm,"Human induced climate change has the potential to alter the function of natural ecosystems and the lives of people on a global scale. The prospect lies not in the distant future but is imminent.

"Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Question of Conscientious Citizenship",GENED 1142,Terry,FAS,General Education,2020 Spring,Full Term,3:00pm - 4:15pm,"What does it mean to be a conscientious citizen? What are our responsibilities as civic-minded, morally-engaged members of overlapping communities? This course seeks to answer such questions by exploring the ethical, religious, and political thought of arguably the greatest public intellectual and activist that the United States ever produced, Martin Luther King, Jr. In interrogating King’s body of public philosophy, as well as its leading critics and interpreters, we will pursue a body of"
Race and Justice,GENED 1146,Shelby,FAS,General Education,2019 Fall,Full Term,10:30am - 11:45am,"We all agree that racism is wrong. Yet beneath this abstract consensus we find deep disagreements about what to do about it, and even about what racism is. We will address these questions by thinking about some very specific issues, drawing on work in philosophy, law, history, and the social sciences. Is racism best understood as a system of beliefs or social structures? What makes racial discrimination wrongful? Should we seek to discourage hate speech, and if so, should it be regulated by law"

In this course we shall survey how this work of literature, through interpretation and re-interpretation, spawned and spawns a wide variety of truths.  Implicit themes: What is truth? How do we know it when we see it? Can a text written long ago contain truths f"
Medicine and Conflict: The History and Ethics of Healing in Political Turmoil,GENED 1150,Bayoumi,FAS,General Education,2019 Fall,Full Term,10:30am - 11:45am,"“War is the only proper school for surgeons,” the Ancient Greek physician, Hippocrates, is quoted to have said. This saying has been used to show how medicine and war have been thought for millennia to shape each. Medicine has played a major role in situations of political conflict, ever since human societies engaged in war and started elaborating “just war doctrines,” that determine how belligerent parties should conduct war, as an attempt to “civilize” war a"
The Incas and Their Empire,GENED 1152,Urton,FAS,General Education,2020 Spring,Full Term,12:00pm - 1:15pm,"The Incas forged an empire across altitudinal extremes and without writing, markets, and the wheel – all typical components of the standard conception of “empire.” How did they do it, and what made their civilization so different from other ancient empires? Did their empire’s collapse after the Spanish conquest eliminate the beliefs, values, and institutions at the heart of Inca society, or might the Spaniards have been influenced by the Incas without knowing it?

"""What is Intellectual History?""",HIST 97B,Blair,FAS,History,2020 Spring,Full Term,3:00pm - 5:45pm,"Intellectual historians study almost every period, place, and theme in human history: from classical times to the present, from Asia to the Americas, by examining philosophy and religion, social and political thought, literature and art, and other expressions of human agency and intention that range from ancient epics to graphic novels. This section will draw examples from a wide range of moments and regions to ask how intellectual history has developed as a field, what methods it uses, and how"
"""What is Environmental History?""",HIST 97D,Amrith,FAS,History,2020 Spring,Full Term,12:00pm - 2:45pm,"This section gives new History concentrators an introduction to environmental history. Most historians leave the natural world out of the story, but environmental historians regard nature as the inescapable context for human history, including the human impact on nature. We will explore how the histories of the environment and of humans can (and perhaps should) be written together. Is there a ""natural archive"" which historians can consult in parallel with conventional libraries and archives? Do"

"""What is Atlantic History?""",HIST 97L,Lewis,FAS,History,2020 Spring,Full Term,12:00pm - 2:45pm,"We live in a world of intense exchange across borders and seas, yet most history is still taught from a national or regional perspective.  By studying inter-regional developments of societies around the Atlantic Ocean, we will examine how the histories of Europe, North America, Latin America and Africa are intertwined.  What methods have historians used to study the trade, migration, inter-imperial competition and revolutionary upheaval that together have helped create an “Atlant"
"""What is International History?""",HIST 97M,Manela,FAS,History,2020 Spring,Full Term,3:00pm - 5:45pm,"Relations between states define some of the most important aspects of human history, including major wars, trade relations, and movements of people, ideas, and cultural productions.

The American Prison & The Literature of Punishment,HIST-LIT 90CF,Dichter,FAS,History & Literature,2019 Fall,Full Term,3:00pm - 5:00pm,"The United States currently keeps more people behind bars than any other country. While the US’s emergence as the leader in incarceration rates is relatively recent, the prison has loomed large in American public life for 200 years. In this class, we will approach the prison not as a marginal phenomenon, but as an institution central to American culture. Readings include works of literature by and about prisoners as well as reformers’ pamphlets, sociological studies, government repor"
Fashion and Slavery,HIST-LIT 90CU,Square,FAS,History & Literature,2019 Fall,Full Term,3:00pm - 5:00pm,"This course examines the politics of fashion among people of African descent during slavery and the period immediately followed emancipation. Fashion is generative, yet underutilized analytic to explore the experience of the enslaved and their descendants. Geographical breadth is crucial to examining the African Diaspora in its full complexity; therefore, course material will cover the United States, Caribbean, Latin America, and Africa. We will examine in particular the relationship between sla"

Do students bear particular responsibility in addressing global inequalities? How does student activism differ from other forms of activism, and how do they intersect?

Speculative Fictions in Multiethnic America,HIST-LIT 90DI,Song,FAS,History & Literature,2019 Fall,Full Term,9:45am - 11:45am,"Speculative fiction, especially science fiction, is known to be a predominantly white genre; data from one source, the sci-fi trade journal Locus, indicates that less than 5% of SF and fantasy books published are by writers of color. This course examines in an intentionally multi-ethnic framework speculative fiction written by African American, Asian American, and white authors alike in the 20th and 21st centuries, which opens us up to the diversity of themes, concepts, and settings to be found"

Old Weird America,HIST-LIT 90DO,Brady,FAS,History & Literature,2019 Fall,Full Term,9:45am - 11:45am,"This seminar focuses on the United States before 1865. Poised halfway between our current moment and the seemingly archaic, superstitious fervor of the Salem Witch Trials, America in the antebellum era was in the process of fitfully, at times reluctantly, becoming modern. We will focus on strange objects—daguerreotypes of dead children, the spectacles created by P. T. Barnum, the seedy newspapers of antebellum New York—and texts that figure the disorienting changes to media, transpor"
American Speeches,HIST-LIT 90DR,Faust,FAS,History & Literature,2019 Fall,Full Term,3:00pm - 5:00pm,"This course will explore speeches across the sweep of American history, examining them both as windows into their own era and as texts created to inform and persuade.  We will ask who speaks and how and the ways that has evolved over time, and we will seek to identify the enduring and changing elements of effective oratory from Jonathan Edwards to Frederick Douglass to J.K.

Our aim will be to engage the longer history of Asian migration and labor in the United States.

Queer Oral Histories,HIST-LIT 90DU,McGeehan Muchmore,FAS,History & Literature,2019 Fall,Full Term,12:45pm - 2:45pm,"This course introduces students to twentieth-century U.S. LGBTQ history through a deep engagement with one of its signature methods­—oral history. Oral history has been an essential method for queer historians because personal narratives shed light on the experiences, perceptions, and desires of sexual and gender minorities who too often appear in textual records only as criminals or patients, if they appear at all. Yet far from being a transparent or privileged window into the past, o"
Red Scares,HIST-LIT 90DV,Biel,FAS,History & Literature,2019 Fall,Full Term,3:00pm - 5:00pm,"When, in his 2019 State of the Union address, President Trump said, “We are born free, and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country,” he invoked American rhetoric that is at least one hundred years old. The first so-called Red Scare, precipitated by World War I and the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia, produced the Espionage Act, which was recently used to charge former CIA analyst Edward Snowden in the leak of classified"

Environmental Justice in North America,HIST-LIT 90DX,Urus,FAS,History & Literature,2019 Fall,Full Term,9:45am - 11:45am,"This course examines how the right to natural resources became contested in North America following European conquest and westward expansion, with a particular emphasis on the period before 1865. Sometimes these contested resources have been clean air, soil, and water, while at other times they included fisheries, forests, agricultural fields, animal pastures, or oil. From when pilgrims first arrived at Plymouth Rock in 1620, race, class, and gender have been the determining factors in regulatin"
Race and American Empire,HIST-LIT 90DY,Mitchell,FAS,History & Literature,2019 Fall,Full Term,12:45pm - 2:45pm,"This course examines the early 20th century expansion of U.S. military influence in the Atlantic and Pacific, and how this expansion shaped and was shaped by theories of race.

Too Soon? Comedy in Europe’s Tragic Twentieth Century,HIST-LIT 90DZ,Brackney,FAS,History & Literature,2020 Spring,Full Term,3:00pm - 5:00pm,"In the first half the twentieth century, Europe was the site of two wars that depleted the world’s population by three percent, dislocated millions, and stripped once diverse regions of the continent of their minority populations. Even as Europe started to rebuild itself in the 1950s, progress occurred under the shadow of two hegemonic superpowers in possession of weapons capable of incinerating not just both sides of the Iron Curtain but the entire planet.What cultural role has comedy pla"
Water Justice and Resistance in the Americas,HIST-LIT 90EA,Mestaz,FAS,History & Literature,2020 Spring,Full Term,3:00pm - 5:00pm,"Water is life, but is it a human right? Water governance is a contentious issue globally because humans rely on water for nearly every productive activity; moreover, it is often scarce and not distributed equally. To better understand the persistence and escalation of struggles over water access around the world, this course uses a multidisciplinary approach that allows students to examine both the social and physical shape of water in a modern and historical context. While all bodies of water d"
Gender and Empire in the Modern Mediterranean,HIST-LIT 90EB,Boonstra,FAS,History & Literature,2020 Spring,Full Term,12:45pm - 2:45pm,"Questions of empire are fundamentally intertwined with questions of gender. This course will focus on the imperial and intercultural contact zones of the Mediterranean—at once connecting and dividing Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa—from the eighteenth to the twenty-first century. With an interest both in men’s and women’s experiences and in representations of masculinity and femininity, our inquiry will also straddle the divide between colonizer and colonized. R"

Philosophy of Language,PHIL 147,Nickel,FAS,Philosophy,2020 Spring,Full Term,10:30am - 11:45am,"Language is of two-fold philosophical interest: intrinsically, it is a complex tool that mediates our relationships with the natural world and with each other. It is also a nexus which reflects metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, and pretty much every other aspect of philosophy. This course will introduce students to theories of language that seek to shed light both on how language works, and what we can learn about other matters from a closer investigation of language.

Divine Providence and the Problem of Evil: Proseminar,PHIL 165,Chen,FAS,Philosophy,2020 Spring,Full Term,12:00pm - 2:00pm,"Theists traditionally believe in divine providence: everything that happens is in accordance with God’s plan. This leads to two well-known puzzles. First, if God has already decided what we will do ahead of time, how is it that we do anything freely? Second, if God is perfectly benevolent, why does God’s plan involve so much human suffering? We will examine these questions, with a focus on how they intersect."

Historical Injustice: Proseminar,PHIL 177I,Mora,FAS,Philosophy,2019 Fall,Full Term,12:00pm - 2:45pm,"What is the moral and political significance of past injustice in the history of a political community? In a variety of national contexts, the redress of historical injustice has struck many as both a legitimate and urgent political cause. Others argue that, since both the original victims and perpetrators of historical injustices are dead, there are no persons who have valid claims against these historical episodes nor, at any rate, are there any individuals who can be rightly held responsible"
Rawls and Liberal Political Philosophy,PHIL 179L,Mora,FAS,Philosophy,2020 Spring,Full Term,12:00pm - 1:15pm,"John Rawls’s publication of ‘A Theory of Justice’ in 1971 was an intellectual lighting bolt. He provided a powerful and systematic defence of an egalitarian liberal framework that reinvigorated Anglo-American political philosophy. Moreover, his philosophical methodology became enormously influential in normative theory, and the questions which preoccupied him set the research agenda for much of the subsequent work in political philosophy. In this course, we will examine contemp"

This leads to the search for new axioms -- axioms which are both justified and sufficiently strong to resolve the questions left undecided by the standard axioms. In this course we will provide a rational reconstruction of the history of the search for new axioms, detailing the"

Modern Moral Philosophy and the History of Ethics,PHIL 265A,Doyle,FAS,Philosophy,2019 Fall,Full Term,1:00pm - 4:00pm,"In her 1958 paper ‘Modern Moral Philosophy’, Elizabeth Anscombe argued that the vocabulary of morality, understood as expressing a sui generis concept delimiting a special class of obligations, reasons, considerations, traits of character and so on, was literally meaningless.

Debates on life extension, gene editing, and artificial intelligence regularly appear in the media, with views ranging from techno-optimism—the idea that such breakthroughs will deliver us from suffering—to the warnings that technoscience is advancing at such a rapid pace, that there is not enough time for ethical guidelines to be developed.

If you are called for jury duty, for example, you will likely be asked whether you are confident you can judge the case with an open mind. If you answer “no,” you will be dismissed from the jury. To have a closed mind is to resist the possibility of persuasion, to be dogmatic, recalcitrant, even bigoted.  But what exactly is an open mind? This course will examine and as"
The Politics of Culture in Europe,SOC-STD 98RC,Brandel,FAS,Social Studies,2020 Spring,Full Term,3:00pm - 5:45pm,"With the birth of “modern Europe,” cultural difference emerged at the center of urgent debates about the organization of society. Even our present political moment seems to be defined by migration “crisis” and globalization. Public discourse appears to be structured by questions about how we might make a place for others in our societies, or whether we should. Does welcoming others require more than the tolerance of their differences? How/should migrants “integ"

American Social Movements,SOC-STD 98SM,Gilson,FAS,Social Studies,2020 Spring,Full Term,3:00pm - 5:45pm,"The world we live in is the product of social movements of all kinds. Yet the means by which they have succeeded in reshaping the world are poorly understood. Even when movement strategies are clear – which they often are not – they are controversial, with activists, academics, and the broader public debating the efficacy and ethics of various protest tactics. This course aims to make sense of these debates by studying a selection of U.S. social movements from the mid-20th century to"

The ""budgeting"" of hours, days, and weeks of a semester often rests on an evaluation of how much time an activity is worth. In this tutorial we will explore how capitalism might shape the way we perceive, understand, and value time.
